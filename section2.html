        Besides computer programming this technique can be used in:
        <ul>
            <li>Mathmatical problems</li>
            <li>Economics</li>
            <li>Bioinformatics</li>
        </ul>
      
        A common usecase in math are the Bellman equations which use a recursive relationship 
        between value functions to calcutate the value of y from the value functions at i-1. 
        The optimal values for all the decision variables can be found by tracking the 
        calculations at each state.

        Economics</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        In economics we can also use value functions to <b>maximize/minimize</b> dynamic social welfare
        problems. Similarly to mathematics we use value functions from previous states in order 
        to find the most optimal solution for solving social economic problems. A good example 
        of this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_problem">Ramsey's problem</a>
        , which in simple terms relates the different levels of 
        utility of a product to the amount of consumption that product takes. An example of 
        this would be for a manufacturer deciding how much to raise the products price so that 
        the revenue equals the total cost of producing the good.

        In bioinformatics algorithms have been used in the case of RNA structure predicting, 
        protein DNA binding, and sequence alignment. The first algorithm of this kind used in 
        bioinformatics was for protein DNA binding developed by Charles DeLisi in the 1970s. 
        As of lately common areas where dynamic programming is used is in transcription factor 
        binding and nucleosome positioning. Here's an example of how dynamic programming is used in bioinformatics: <br><br>
